## Danger Ahead

This chapter is a toolbox for GMs, providing a roster of dangers, monsters, and machines with which you can challenge your players.

If you’re a player and not a GM, we strongly recommend you skip this chapter — the material here may be more enjoyable to learn about as a character during gameplay. You may decide to read it anyway, but be warned that this makes you a candidate for running the game in the future!
