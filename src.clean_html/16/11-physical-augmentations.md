# Physical Augmentations

Less combat-oriented, but no less useful, these body mods increase capabilities and provide new abilities. Note that many other pieces of equipment can be attached to a synthmorph’s shell and linked to their power systems and mesh inserts (GM discretion).

**Circadian Regulation:** Your morph only requires 2 hours of sleep to maintain health and function at peak mental capacity. You dream constantly while asleep and can both fall asleep and wake up almost instantly. You can also easily shift to a 2-day cycle, awake for 44 hours then sleeping for 4, with no ill effects. You need only 2 hours for a long recharge of your pools ([Recharging Pools](../03/05-pools.md#recharging-pools)).

**Cold Tolerance:** Your morph’s temperature regulation and circulation are substantially enhanced, allowing you to survive in temperatures as low as −80&nbsp;°C/−112&nbsp;°F without discomfort or ill effects. This mod is common on Mars, allowing you to handle the weather without heavy clothing.

**Cryogenic Protection:** The morph features special insulation and heating. Biomorphs can withstand −120&nbsp;°C temps, or down to −200&nbsp;°C in environments with 0.1 atmospheres or less. Synthmorphs can handle the coldest temperatures in the Solar System.

**Cyberlimb:** Standard replacement cyberlimbs function the same as their biological equivalents, though they are made of sturdier materials. Apply a +5 bonus to SOM Checks. They have a 6/4&nbsp;AV when targeted specifically. Since limbs can easily be regrown, some people consider cybernetic prostheses to be vulgar and distasteful; others treat them as iconic symbols of self-expression. They can be equipped with hidden compartments, lights, speakers, holographic projectors, [weapon mounts](../16/10-combat-augmentations.md), and other add-ons. They may also be disguised to appear real with a [synthetic mask](../16/09-social-augmentations.md). You may have multiple cyberlimbs.

**Cyberlimb Plus:** More extravagant cyberlimb models are available, though they require more severe body alteration. These may be replacement limbs or extra limbs anchored in the body’s skeletal frame. Treat these the same as standard cyberlimbs, but also increase your Vigor pool by 1. Though you can apply a synthetic mask to cyberlimb plus mods, this just provides an aesthetic effect, the limb remains obviously artificial.

**Enhanced Respiration:** With increased lung efficiency and blood oxygen-carrying capacity, you can breathe comfortably in both highand low-pressure environments, from 0.2 to 5 atmospheres, with no dizziness or need for gradual decompression. You can also hold your breath for up to 30 minutes when performing minimal activity, or for up to 10 minutes with strenuous activity. This augmentation allows you to breathe the atmosphere of Mars without aid.

**Fractal Digits:** Your morph has “bush robot” digits that are capable of splitting into smaller digits, and those smaller digits into micro digits, and so on down to the nanometer scale. These fingers can operate independently, allowing for ultra-fine manipulation. When coupled with nanoscopic vision, this even allows you to manipulate individual nanobots. Apply a +10 modifier to Hardware Tests where microor nano-manipulation is an important factor. The cybernetic version of this mod can only be applied to cyberlimbs.

**Gas-Jet System:** Nozzles in your chest, back, and limbs allow you to maneuver in micrograv with vectored bursts of gas. +10 to Free Fall Tests.

**Gills:** The morph’s lung tissue is adapted to function as gills, allowing you to breathe both air and water, as long as the water is not toxic or too stagnant. Water you breathe in through the gills is expelled through slits just underneath your lowest pair of ribs that seal when you are not underwater.

**Grip Pads:** You have specialized pads imitating the pads of gecko feet on your palms, lower arms, shins, and the bottoms of your feet. These pads adhere to any surface not made of a material designed to resist this augmentation. You can climb and support yourself on any surface that can support your weight. Apply a +30 modifier to Athletics Tests for climbing. You can also climb at a rate equal to your full move. The pads must be free to touch the surface (no shoes or gloves). The pads are obvious, but do not impair your manual dexterity or sense of touch.

**Hibernation:** You can voluntarily decrease your metabolism down to only requiring 5% of the normal amount of food, water, and air. In this state, you appear to be in a deep sleep, but maintain awareness of both touch and sound and so can be easily awakened. Entering or leaving this state requires 3 minutes. With sufficient air, you can safely hibernate for up to 40 days without food or water.

**Hidden Compartment:** The shell has a concealed aperture for a shielded interior compartment, ideal for storing valuables or smuggling contraband. On small morphs, micro items can be hidden. On medium morphs, very small objects. On large morphs, small items. Concealed gear acquires a +30 modifier to Infiltrate Tests against both manual and sensor scans. The cybernetic version of this mod only applies to cyberlimbs. You may have multiple compartments.

**Magnetic System:** A mag system allows you to cling to most ferrous materials. This enables you to hang from metal ceilings or fixtures, walk in micrograv by adhering to surfaces, and hold onto devices without letting them drop or drift away. You receive a +30 to SOM Checks to maintain a grip on magnetically held objects.

**Mobility System:** Your morph is upgraded with an additional means of getting around ([Movement Types](../12/24-movement.md#movement-types)). Any movement type can be chosen that works with your shell’s design, with approval from the GM. You may have multiple (different) systems.

**Modular Design:** This shell is designed to lock together with flexbots and similar modular morphs to create larger gestalt forms. When united with other modules, the group is treated as a single unit/morph, with shared capabilities ([Flexbot Rules](../04/25-synthmorphs.md#flexbot-rules)).

**Nanotat ID Flux:** Your nanotat ID can be reconfigured with a new legit or fake ID in one action turn.

**Oxygen Reserve:** A miniature oxygen tank and rebreather is installed in your torso. When activated, it overrides your breathing reflex, feeding oxygen directly into your blood stream. This provides you with air for 4 hours and avoids problems with pressure changes. Implanted sensors automatically activate the implant if they detect poisonous or insufficient atmosphere (Know: Chemistry 80). This mod does not protect from vacuum exposure, but it will keep you conscious and active for longer, giving you time to find a vacsuit or help. Once the reserve is expended, it recovers one hour of oxygen for every hour you spend in a breathable atmosphere (or 15 minutes in a high-oxygen environment).

**Prehensile Feet:** You can use your feet like hands. Your feet and leg joints are altered so that your toes are longer and more dexterous. The big toe is transformed into an opposable thumb. Physically, your morph’s feet resemble a longer, narrower hand or a foot with finger-like toes. You can walk normally but must wear specially designed shoes. However, you run slightly slower than a morph with unmodified feet (−8 to your full movement). Your hips are also modified for greater mobility and flexibility. In a properly constructed chair, or floating in zero g, you can use both your hands and feet to manipulate the same object. This mod is common among belters, brinkers, and others living in microgravity.

**Prehensile Tail:** Your morph is equipped with a 1.5-meter long tail, extending out from your tailbone/backside. This tail is prehensile and you can use it to grab, hold, and manipulate objects. You can control your tail’s movements with concentration, but otherwise it tends to move on its own. Your tail also improves balance; apply a +10 modifier to Athletics or other tests where balance is a factor.

**Pressure Adaptation:** Your morph can handle extreme hydrostatic pressure conditions, up to 500 (biomorphs) or 2,500 (synthmorphs) atmospheres. It also acclimates to pressure changes quickly and is immune to oxygen toxicity, nitrogen narcosis, and the bends.

**Retracting Limbs:** Some or all of your limbs can retract completely inside your shell’s frame. A limb can hold one very small item while retracted (small morphs can hold micro items, large morphs small items). Retracted limbs and the items they hold can not be targeted in combat. Retracted items are concealed (+30 Infiltrate). This mod cannot be combined with hidden compartment or telescoping limb.

**Shape Adjusting:** This shell is made from smart materials that allow it to alter its shape, height, width, circumference, and external features, while retaining the same mass. The ability to change shape is not completely unlimited, due to the shell’s internal components; work with the GM to establish what is possible. This mod is primarily used to reshape the morph into special pre-set configurations adapted to specific tasks (for example, lengthening to crawl through a tunnel, widening its base for stability, expanding to reach out and attach to multiple access points simultaneously, and so on). Shapechanging allows you to change your composition to function as any 2 Minor complexity items/ware or 1 Moderate complexity item/ware allowed by the GM (no blueprint needed). Extra sets of limbs count as Minor ware. Simple shapes and mechanical designs are easy to create, but advanced electronics, complex designs, and specialized components are beyond the scope of this mod. Altering shape takes at minimum 1d6 minutes, and can take as long as 1d6 hours for substantial changes. This mod also allows the morph to change its features for disguise purposes; apply a +30 modifier to disguise-based Deceive or Exotic Skill: Disguise Tests.

**Skinlink:** Skinlink nanobots live on the morph’s external skin or shell, automatically swarming over and creating a physical connection with any electronics you touch. They also take advantage of the electrical field in a biomorph’s skin for communication. They allow you to communicate and mesh with skinlink-equipped devices, devices with external access ports, devices with exposed electronics, or other skinlinked characters merely by touching them. This is considered a wired link, and so is not subject to sniffing or jamming.

**Skin Pocket:** A pocket within your skin layer provides concealment (+30 Infiltrate) for very small items.

**Thermogenic Protection:** The synthmorph can operate in high-temperature environments with heat sinks and coolant systems, able to withstand up to 1,000&nbsp;°C. This also provides AV +5/0.

**Utilimod:** This mod duplicates the functions of a [utilitool](../16/05-common-tech-and-ware.md#everyday-technology). Retractable smart material tool “arms” are implanted — usually spaced around the wrist, but other locations are possible — that can change shape into almost any type of specialized tool desired in 1d6 minutes. These tools can take on numerous functions, including that of a [fiber eye](../16/17-espionage-and-security-tech.md) or an implanted [knife](../12/02-melee-combat.md#melee-weapons).

**Vacuum Sealing:** Your morph is modified to survive the effects of vacuum. You can seal your mouth, nose, and other orifices to prevent the freezing of bodily fluids from evaporative cooling. A special membrane protects your eyes, enabling you to see in vacuum without distortion or damage. Your system is also protected from the effects of decompression sickness and hypoxia. You are still vulnerable to asphyxiation, radiation, and possibly heat (in sunlight) or heat loss (in shade), and so this mod is often coupled with oxygen reserve cyberware, respirocytes, and/or cold tolerance.

**Wings:** Your morph is equipped with a pair of wings; either additional limbs or restructured arms. For small morphs, this allows gliding and limited flight in Earth-like gravities. Medium-sized morphs can fly in gravity less than 0.15&nbsp;g; in higher gravity they may be used to glide. Large and very large morphs may not use this augmentation. Most wing designs are transgenic and based on bat physiology, so that they may be easily folded when not in use. If combined with the retracting limb ware, these wings may be folded into your arms or back.
