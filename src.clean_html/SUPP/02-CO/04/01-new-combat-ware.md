### Acceleration Tolerance

You are modified to handled the g-force of sudden and sustained acceleration, as is sometimes required in spacecraft maneuvering and combat, without falling unconscious or suffering serious medical issues. Biomorphs can handle up to 200 g of force for a second or two, 15 g of sustained acceleration for at least 1 minute. Synthmorphs can handle double this amount without suffering damage.

### Boomscatter

This mod is only available to morphs with shape adjusting ware. You are designed to diffuse the force of impacts and explosions by scattering into dozens or even hundreds of small pieces. You may reduce the effect of one collision, melee attack, concussive blast, or high-explosive blast by half. Your scattered components take 1d6 x 10 minutes to reassemble. During this period, you may not engage in physical actions, including Fray Tests, and your AV is 0/0.

If you are a flexbot or similar modular system targeted by a melee attack, you may choose 1 module to scatter and take the halved damage of the attack. The rest of your modules remain combined.

### Diamond Buzzsaw

One of your limbs is equipped with a diamondcoated buzzsaw that pops out when you need it.

### Grasping Tendril

This elongated tentacle-like prehensile limb extends 2 meters from the mouth (or another orifice). It can be used to grasp small items or attack. It is concealable, inflicts DV 1d10 + 2 in melee, provides a Reach bonus (+10), and an additional +10 modifier to [grappling attacks](../../../12/02-melee-combat.md#grappling) (_EP2_).

### Injectors

This mod can only be used by swarm morphs. Your microbots carry tiny needles and a distributed chemical, drug, or toxin payload. You carry one dose for every 10 points of DUR. When you attack, you can choose to inject any targets within your swarm with one dose.

### Jaws

This mod can only be used by swarm morphs. Your microbots are equipped with diamandoid jaws and snippers. Your swarm attacks inflict an extra DV 1d6.

### Omni-Joints

This mod only functions with shape adjusting ware. Your smart material construction can configure omni-directional joints on the fly, enabling amazing feats of balance and movement and tricks with your limbs. This allows you to bend over backwards, reach around corners, and grapple things like a bolo. You can even use this multi-jointed capability to bypass an opponent’s guard in melee, like a flail swinging around a shield. Apply +10 to Athletics, Fray, and Melee Tests.

### Stealth Coating

Your shell is covered with metamaterials with a negative refractive index. When activated, both electromagnetic and acoustic waves bend around you, making you invisible to such sensors (including sight and sonar). Apply −60 to Perceive Tests to spot you, attacks against you are blind (−30 to hit with a 50% miss chance). Even if you are detected, you appear hazy and insubstantial (−30 to hit).

The coating is tunable; you can pass specific frequency ranges (i.e., you can be stealthed to infrared but not radar). You can also make the electromagnetic coating one-way, so that you can transmit out while being stealthed at the same frequency, but such transmissions can be used to detect you.

While stealthed, you are blind/deaf to the selected frequencies (this also means you are no longer meshed if you let radio bypass you). To avert this, you can pass certain frequencies for sensing or enable radio and perceive via meshed remote sensors (perhaps receiving a penalty to actions).

You can also create small windows to perceive/transceive through, but these can be spotted with the right sensors and a Perceive Test at −30.

While invisible, you do not radiate heat (unless you choose to pass thermal frequencies and be visible in infrared). At the GM’s discretion, prolonged stealthing (over an hour) can lead to penalties from overheating.

The acoustic stealthing is one-way only and does not affect sounds generated by you, such as speaking or the noise of your movement or footfalls.

The stealthing provided by this coat has no effect on non-electromagnetic and non-acoustic sensors (vibration sensors, pressure sensors, chemical sniffers, etc.). Stealth coating is not compatible with chameleon skin and some armor mods (GM discretion).
