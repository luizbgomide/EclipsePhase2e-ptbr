# Shape Adjusting

Flexbots truly shine when they take advantage of their [shape adjusting ware](../../16/11-physical-augmentations.md) (_EP2_). This is the core of their verstaility. The rules here expand upon those given in the core book.

## How Does It Work?

The bulk of a flexbot’s mass is made of programmable nanoscale robotics elements called smart matter. This matter features a periphery of electromagnets that can be individually activated and deactivated, giving it the capability to move and physically bind together, creating different shapes. In a module’s default form, these microscopic components are secured together in a structural lattice. When a new design is programmed, the smatter matter methodically disassembles its existing shape and re-assembles in its new configuration.

A typical flexbot also includes a minimal amount of dumb-matter structural components such as chassis struts and plates, primarily used for stability and as a base framework. These components are embedded within smart matter housings such that they can be easily repositioned. This saves time on major reconfigurations.

Smart matter can be assembled into a wide range of skeletal frameworks and mechanical components: struts, tubing, mounts, brackets, joints, chains, pulleys, wires, pistons, servos, gears, motors, etc. It can also shape gross structural features (shells, limbs, heads, torsos) and mobility systems (wheels, tracks, rotor blades, engines).

Flexbots also incorporate a number of optoelectronic components, also mounted within smart matter for quick reconfiguration. This includes quantum dots, which provide a range of superconductive, optical, and electronics applications. This gives the flexbot limited capabilities for assembling specific electronics equipment.

Finally, each flexbot module also carries a small selection of components that would otherwise be challenging for smart matter to replicate, so that it can assemble certain specific pieces of gear, according to that module’s particular specializations.

### Speed of Change

Flexbot alterations are not instantaneous; they take anywhere from a few seconds or minutes to several hours. The actual timeframe depends on the severity of the change, and should be decided on by GM and player, following the guidelines on the Shape-Changing Requirements table. Times listed are for pre-set configurations; self-programmed changes may take up to double the timeframe (GM discretion).

### Actions

Initiating a shape-change to a known preconfigured state is a simple matter of executing programmed instructions, taking only a quick action. If the alterations involve new or unusual shapes, it may require a complex action. Exotic configurations or assembling gear outside of the module’s usual repertoire may require a Program Test with a timeframe (GM discretion) to code the proper instructions.

Once a shape alteration is underway, the process runs itself, though it may require occasional oversight from the operator. Maintaining one or more ongoing shape adjustments consumes a quick action every turn, until the operations are complete.

### Physical Inhibitions

The process of reshaping sometimes inhibits a flexbot’s physical actions. For example, if you modify the structure of an existing limb, you cannot use that limb while it is being reconfigured—and if you do, something may go wrong. A flexbot made of multiple modules is not likely to be severely restricted if one module is assembling a minor piece of gear, but will be impeded if multiple modules are restructuring or if the module in question also provides a critical piece of gear that is currently in use. GM discretion is necessary to evaluate the impact of any ongoing changes. As a general rule, apply modifiers for ongoing changes to any physical actions as noted on the Shape-Changing Requirements table, but otherwise use your best judgment. Treat major changes as an ongoing task action; no other actions are possible until the operation is complete.

It is, of course, entirely possible to set a module aside while it adjusts its shape, re-incorporating it once the process is finished.

## Shape Adjusting vs. Nanofab

It is important to note that shape adjusting ware does not function the same as nanofabrication. With nanofab, items are constructed from raw materials from the molecular level on up. Smart matter does not fabricate anything, it is made of tiny pre-existing building blocks that are capable of re-ordering themselves. When a flexbot uses shape-adjusting to craft gear, it is not building it from raw atoms, it is reconfiguring smart matter to copy that gear’s specific shape and design. Any components which the smart matter cannot emulate (optics, electronics, etc.) must be added (though if it is within inventory, the smart matter can move it into place). Smart matter is faster to assemble an item than nanofab, but also more limited in what it can put together.

## What Can It Do?

A flexbot’s shape adjusting can be broken down into two functions: altering its physical form and assembling gear. Each of these is addressed below.

For both of these functions, flexbot modules are equipped with libraries of pre-set configurations. These programs instruct the smart matter on how to reshape, sometimes giving the operator a set of parameters they may adjust to fine-tune the operation. These pre-sets are also optimized, allowing the smart matter to reorganize itself with speed and efficiency.

Operators are not bound to only adhere to these pre-set shapes. Smart matter can also be instructed in general terms and with smaller function pre-sets. For example, you could simply instruct the module to expand its circumference, shorten a limb, or adopt a winch shape using gear-and-pulley pre-sets. More complex shapes may require nanofab blueprints or Program Tests to improvise.

### Form Alterations

As described in the core book, smart matter allows a module to alter its shape, height, width, circumference, and external features, all while retaining the same mass. A typical flexbot module is 0.75 m high × 0.75 m long × 0.25 m wide and about 35 kg in mass. While these dimensions can be altered, extensions of mass can impact the protective capabilities of the flexbot’s frame and armor.

A module (and by extension, a whole flexbot) can alter its forms in the following ways:

- Compress itself up to 25% in any dimension by extending mass in another dimension.
- Compress itself up to 50% in any dimension by extending mass in another dimension. Reduce AV by 25%.
- Extend itself up to 25% in any dimension.
- Extend itself up to 50% in any dimension. Reduce AV by 25%.
- Extend itself up to double its size along any dimension. Reduce AV by 50%.
- Extend itself up to 50% along one dimension and up to double along another. Reduce AV by 75%. A module extended in this fashion is considered medium size instead of small. A multi-module flexbot increases its size category one step.

Some other specific form-alteration ideas are discussed under [Flexbot Tricks](05-flexbot-tricks.md). Note that individual flexbot modules are not designed to split apart; any attempt to divide one into pieces will severely damage it.

### Gear Assembly

Shapechanging allows you to change your module’s composition to function as any 2 Minor complexity items/ware or 1 Moderate complexity item/ware. Exactly what gear is allowed must be negotiated between player and GM, using the following guidelines.

Simple shapes and mechanical designs are easy to create. This includes basic tools such as hammers, screwdrivers, pry bars, wrenches, etc., as well as basic weapons like knives or spears. It also includes more complex but still largely mechanical or motor-driven tools, such as drills, electric saws, chainsaws, and even piston spears and firearms (but not railguns due to the superconducting electromagnet requirements).

Items that incorporate advanced electronics, complex designs, or specialized components are usually beyond the scope of smart matter to replicate.

**Common Shape Adjustments:** Since each flexbot is specialized for specific tasks, each module incorporates a small library of specialized components and designs that allow it to assemble items that normally would be beyond the capabilities of smart matter. These exception items are noted under Common Shape Adjustments in each module’s listing. These items are subject to GM discretion; if an item doesn’t seem plausible to you, feel free to ignore it. Likewise, GMs can use these listings as guidelines. If another gear item falls beyond the capabilities of smart matter, but makes a lot of sense for a module to have, consider including it.

**Gear vs. Ware:** Any gear assembled via smart matter is assumed to be integrated into the flexbot itself and should be treated as implanted hardware. Gear may not removed without damaging the flexbot.

**Extra Limbs:** Note that extra sets of limbs count as Minor ware.

**Mobility Systems:** Flexbots can assemble any mechanical mobility systems, which is almost all of them ([Movement Types](../../12/24-movement.md#movement-types) in _EP2_). Ionic and thrust vector (rocket) systems are beyond the capabilities of smart matter. Note that flexbots aren’t buoyant in water or most fluids, requiring a swim bladder, flotation, or ballast to adopt boat or submarine movement.

## Alternative Gear Assembly

The rules for shape-changing described here are meant to reflect transhumanity’s technology level and a modicum of scientific plausability. If they don’t tickle your sensors, we present three alternative methods for handling shape adjusting:

**Pre-Sets:** Ditch the free-form gear assembly. Instead, each module comes with 6 points of pre-programmed gear pre-sets. Minor complexity gear costs 1 point, Moderate costs 2. The module can assemble only gear it has pre-sets for. It may still alter its form per normal. Pre-sets cannot be changed.

**Blueprints:** Instead of free-form assembly, modules can only assemble gear for which they have an assembly blueprint. These blueprints are not the same as nanofab blueprints, but do have the same complexity. Each module comes with 6 points of blueprints installed; a Minor complexity item costs 1, Moderate costs 2.

**Cinematic:** Some players want flexbots that can shape-change in the middle of a combat scene. Normally, such rapid changing would be confined to higher technology levels, such as TITAN machines. If you’re willing to hand-wave this for more cinematic action, then allow Minor complexity gear to be assembled in a single action turn, while Moderate takes two turns.
