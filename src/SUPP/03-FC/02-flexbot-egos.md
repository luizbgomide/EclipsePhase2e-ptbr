# Flexbot Egos

Every flexbot module is equipped with its own cyberbrain, mesh inserts, and cortical stack. This makes them ideal for operators who favor forking or want to bring others along on a ride and provides several options not available to other morphs.

## Cyberbrains

The admin ego operating the flexbot must choose one module as its control module—the ego resides within this module’s cyberbrain. Switching control to another module/cyberbrain is easy, taking just 1 complex action; once initiated, the handover completes at the beginning of your next turn. Switching modules within a flexbot does not require any Integration or Resleeving Tests.

When you switch to a new module, you must decide whether you are transferring your ego to the new module and purging it from the old one, or whether you are creating an alpha fork of yourself and keeping a copy of your ego in each module. Purging is automatic and considered part of the transfer process.

The unoccupied cyberbrains of non-control modules are puppeted to the control module. To remotely hack an unoccupied cyberbrain, you must first gain access to the control module’s cyberbrain. However, unoccupied cyberbrains may be directly hacked if they are physically accessed.

If the controlling ego evacuates the morph entirely, the flexbot goes into dormant stand-by mode.

### Forking

If the controlling ego forks, one of the copies must be designated as the controlling ego. Depending on the jurisdiction and local legalities, it may be important to note which ego is considered the primary and which an alpha fork.

## Multiple Egos

One of the advantage of flexbots is that with multiple cyberbrains and mesh inserts, there is plenty of room to carry additional egos within the morph: forks of the controlling ego, other egos, muses, and even ALIs. Ghostrider modules can be installed or assembled for even more room. Each cyberbrain, ghostrider module, or set of mesh inserts can hold 1 ego (including ALIs). Extra egos are either treated as passengers or given split control.

### Passengers

Egos that are brought on as passengers are simply along for the ride. Passengers have no control over the flexbot’s modules or systems because they are not given access privileges. Passengers can be provided with access to the mesh and/or the flexbot’s sensory inputs, as well as internally communicate with the controlling ego. If given mesh access, passengers can remotely control detached modules, just like any other drone.

### Split Controls

Extra egos carried in the flexbot can be given privileges that provide control over specific flexbot functions: mobility, sensors, tools/ware, weapons, and so on. This functions similar to the multi-ego control ware available in certain other morphs. An ego with admin privileges can expand, remove, or switch these controls with a complex action. Each ego goes on their own Initiative order, allowing the morph to act multiple times during the action turn. Each ego must be assigned a specific function of the morph to control: movement, perception, specific weapons, or other capabilities. Only one ego may control a specific function each action turn, though other egos may access data from systems controlled by others. The morph’s pools are shared by all linked egos. Modifiers applied to the morph affect each linked ego.

### Swapping Modules

If two egos within a flexbot want to swap places with each other, this takes only an action turn, just like transferring to another module, assuming there is at least one non-occupied cyberbrain, mesh inerts ware, or ghostrider module to act as a buffer to run one of the egos during the swap. If no unoccupied ware is available, the process takes 3 full action turns as the egos are carefully switched.

### Muses

Muses usually stick with their ego; if their owner switches to a new module they travel with them, transitioning to the mesh inserts on that module. Muses can also be placed in unoccupied cyberbrains to control specific flexbot functions or remotely operate modules.

## Cortical Stacks

Each flexbot module carries its own cortical stack. For security purposes, these stacks are hardwired to only take input from their local cyberbrain. This means that the controlling ego’s mind is backed up to the cortical stack of the module it currently inhabits. If the ego switches to a different module, it begins using that stack to backup its mind. If the ego makes a habit of switching modules, the various stacks carried within the flexbot may each be carrying snapshots of the controlling ego taken at different times.

Extra egos carried within a flexbot’s additional cyberbrains may also be backed up to that specific module’s cortical stack. Any previous egos carried within that stack are overwritten.

### Stack Location

Due to a flexbot’s shape-adjusting capabilities, the location of a cortical stack within a module changes according to their current form. Operators can also instruct the stack to be placed within a specific part of the module’s structure. You may prefer it carried deep inside your center of mass, or you may prefer it held in an appendage or surface area where it can be easily retrieved. An unusual or hidden location increases the time it takes to pop the morph’s stack ([Popping a Stack](../../15/01-backups-and-uploading.md#popping-a-stack) in _EP2_) by up to 10 minutes (GM discretion).

## Accessing Other Modules

Like any important electronics device, modules are protected from unauthorized access. If your flexbot comes across a stray module, you can’t just absorb it into your own. However, modules can be hacked, using the normal mesh rules. A hacked unoccupied module can be taken on as one of your own.

Given that flexbots often carry unoccupied cyberbrains, modules make a tempting target for hackers. If two egos within a flexmorph (or accessing remotely) both have admin privileges, they can contest for control of the entire morph. Any action may be opposed as an automatic action by another admin ego with an Opposed Interface Test. If the opponent succeeds, no action is taken. If you have a lockbox app, you can attempt to lock the other ego out ([Trap Ego](../../13/17-mindware-hacking.md#trap-ego) in _EP2_).
