# Meshware

Meshware refers to plug-in apps that enhance an infomorph’s capabilities, much like the bioware and hardware for physical morphs. Meshware takes only a complex action to install or uninstall. Once installed, meshware remains with the infomorph when it moves or copies. Meshware can also be installed within cyberbrains. Other apps can also be installed as meshware, so they are embedded within the infomorph. Unlike other apps, meshware cannot be used by non-infomorph/cyberbrained users.

**App-Lock:** App-lock makes it more difficult for an installed app to be removed without proper authentication (apply a −30 modifier). This is useful for infomorphs/cyberbrains that are brainhacked and modified against their will. The protected apps must be designated in advance (when app-lock is installed or reconfigured).

**Auto-Erase:** This app will automatically erase the infomorph (or the ego within a cyberbrain) if certain pre-programmed conditions are met. This is useful if you are worried about brainhacking, forknapping, or being trapped in a lockbox. Common trigger conditions include detected brainhacking, a codephrase, psychosurgery, a designated time period, or upon failure to receive a periodic message. Some people use this app to keep forks from going errant; many polities legally require forks to be equipped to delete themselves after a set number of hours. Auto-erase functions even if the infomorph does not have privileges on that system.

**Copylock:** Copylock prevents an infomorph (or ego within a cyberbrain) from copying, whether voluntarily or not, without proper authorization. This is used to restrict forks, indentures, and people who don’t trust themselves. It also defends against forknappers: brainhackers that attempt to copy the infomorph suffer −30 to their Infosec Tests. Copylock also prevents an infomorph from moving between devices or sleeving into a morph.

**Enhanced Security:** This meshware installs additional firewall and security layers, making the infomorph/cyberbrain harder to hack. Apply a −10 modifier to attempts to brainhack your digital mind.

You can also use this meshware to enter a heightened state of security — Defensive Mode. When activated with a quick action, the modifier to brainhack you is increased to −30. This lock-down status impairs your functions, however; you cannot use Insight pool while it is active and suffer a −3 Initiative modifier.

**E-Veil:** E-veil obfuscates the presence of designated apps within the infomorph’s code. Any attempt to scan the infomorph using Interface is opposed with a Program skill of 80. The hidden apps must be designated when e-veil is activated.

**Fault Tolerance:** This module provides redundancy and loadsharing functions. You receive AV 5 against mesh attacks.

**Persistence:** This meshware uses rootkit techniques to keep the digital mind active despite attempts to crash it. Increase the infomorph’s Durability by 10 and Wound Threshold by 2.
