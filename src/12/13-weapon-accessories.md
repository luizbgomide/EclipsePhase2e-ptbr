**Arm Slide:** This slide-mount can hold a one-handed weapon under your sleeve, pushing the weapon into your hand with an electronic signal or specific sequence of arm movements. You can draw the weapon and attack with a single complex action.

**Extended Magazine:** This ammunition case has an enhanced capacity. Increase the weapon’s ammo capacity by +50%. This is only available for firearms and seekers.

**Gyromount:** This weapon harness features a gyro-stabilized weapon mount that keeps the weapon steady. Negate all modifiers from movement.

**Imaging Scope:** Imaging scopes attach to the top of the weapon and act like [specs](../16/05-common-tech-and-ware.md#everyday-technology). Scopes also bend like a periscope, allowing you to point the weapon and target around corners without leaving cover.

**Flash Suppressor:** This device obscures the muzzle flash on firearms, applying a −30 modifier to Perceive Tests to locate a firing weapon by its flash.

**Laser Sight:** This underbarrel laser emits a beam that places a glowing red dot on the target to assist targeting (negating the −10 modifier for not using a smartlink or laser sight). Laser sights can also be used to paint a target for laser-guided smart ammo or seekers. Infrared and ultraviolet lasers are also available, so that the dot is only visible to characters with enhanced vision.

**Safety System:** This feature is automatically included in most weapons. A biometric (palmprint or voiceprint) or ego ID sensor is embedded in the weapon, disabling it if anyone other than an authorized user attempts to fire it.

**Shock Safety:** Just like a safety system, except that an unauthorized user is zapped with an electric shock, inflicting DV 1d6 and a [shock effect](15-special-attacks.md#shock-attacks).

**Silencer/Sound Suppressor:** This barrel-mounted accessory reduces the sound of a firearm’s discharge (they cannot be used on railguns). Apply a −30 modifier on hearing-based Perceive Tests to hear or locate the gun’s firing.

**Smartlink:** Smartlinks are automatically included in most weapons. It connects the weapon to your mesh inserts, placing a targeting bracket in your field of vision and providing range and targeting information (negating the −10 modifier for not using a smartlink or laser sight). Smartlinks also incorporate a microcamera that allows the user to see what the weapon is pointed at, fire around corners, etc. Smartlinks also allow certain other types of weapon system control, such as changing [smart ammo](09-kinetic-weapons.md#smart-ammo) or programming seeker [trigger conditions](10-seeker-weapons-and-grenades.md#trigger-conditions).

**Smart Magazine:** A smart magazine allows you to pick and choose what ammo round will be fired with each shot. This system leaves less room for bullets, however, so reduce the weapon’s ammunition capacity by half (round up). Smart magazines can be combined with extended magazines, in which case ammo capacity is normal.
