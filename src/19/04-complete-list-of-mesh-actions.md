## Simple Hacking

If these rules at first seem intimidating, keep in mind that the core hacking rules are fairly straightforward. The following guidelines should get you through most situations:

- Almost all hacking-involved tests pit the hacker’s Infosec vs. the target system’s Firewall.
- To hack into a system, you have a choice of fast (immediate, −30 modifier, triggers an alert) or slow (no modifier, takes an hour, no alert).
- By default, you get in with standard user privileges. Superior successes get you better privileges.
- Once in, you can take any action that your privileges allow without making a test.
- If your privileges don’t allow it, make a Hacking Test (Infosec vs. Firewall) to pull it off.
- Use your imagination! If you want to do something — loop sensors, jam weapons, steal files, open a door, crash an opposing AI — your GM will tell if you need to make a test.
- Don’t forget to use Insight pool for extra mesh actions or to modify rolls!

## Consolidated Hacking

Sometimes a PC may want to hack a system that is less consequential to the story. Rather than running each hack step-by-step, the GM can consolidate such a hack into a single task action Infosec Test. First, the hacker should compile a brief list of objectives after hacking in (e.g., locate a file, unlock a door, loop a sensor feed, eliminate traces). Set a timeframe of 1 hour plus 10 minutes per objective. If brute forcing, the timeframe is 2 action turns per objective. Apply the following modifiers: −30 if brute forcing, +10 if hacking a mote, −10 if hacking a server, and −10 if hacking multiple systems.

| Infosec Test Result | Hacking Result                                                        |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Critical Failure    | Hack fails, hacker traced.                                            |
| Superior Failure    | Hack fails.                                                           |
| Failure             | Hacker achieves first objective only.                                 |
| Success             | Hacker achieves all objectives.                                       |
| Superior Success    | Hacker achieves all objectives in 25% less time per superior success. |
| Critical Success    | Hacker achieves all objectives, backdoors system.                     |
